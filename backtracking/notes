Backtracking
This is a general approach of solving problem where we have to find all combinations or combinations which adhere to some constraint. So we pick all valid candidates to our solution and discard the not useful one. (one which doesnt match a constraint)

Backtracking template:

def backtrack(candidate):
    if find_solution(candidate):
        output(candidate)
        return

    # iterate all possible candidates.
    for next_candidate in list_of_candidates:
        if is_valid(next_candidate):
            # try this partial candidate solution
            place(next_candidate)
            # given the candidate, explore further.
            backtrack(next_candidate)
            # backtrack
            remove(next_candidate)
